                    <h2>What is RC Racing?</h2>
                    <p>
                        RC Racing is a racing game made in Unity. It was made for the 2019 GMTK game jam, where the theme was "only one".
                        I made a racing game in which you control an RC car. However, you have only one battery for the remote.
                        So, you have to move the battery in the remote to alternate between moving forward and left or forward and right.

                    <h2>When was the game jam?</h2>
                    <p>The game jam took place from the 2nd to the 4th of August 2019</p>

                    <h2>What are the controls?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The mouse is used to move the battery. Drag and drop it into the remote to move the car.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What went right/wrong during development?</h2>
                    <p>
                        During the game jam, one of the things I struggled with was the AI for the opponent.
                        I originally wanted to make the AI send out 3 rays each at 45 degrees to each other. If at the end of the ray, there was the players car or a point off the track,
                        it would turn accordingly. However, I was unable to implement the AI like this. Due to the time limit, I had to make the AI follow a set path.
                        However, after doing some research a few weeks later, I slightly rewrote the AI.
                        Instead of following a set path, it would treat each point on the path as the center point of a circle and pick a random point within that circle.
                        It would then travel to that point.<br />
                        I think one of the big things that went right here was my development cycle. As, after coming up with an idea, I was able to quickly make a prototype.
                        After making this prototype, I decided that this was a viable option and developed it further.
                        Additionally, I was able to plan how long to spend on each feature accurately. Because of this I was able to finish and submit my game roughly an hour early.
                        I was lucky with this, as I was able to avoid the crash the website had around the time most people were submitting.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Where can I play the game/access the source code?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Both the game and the source code can be found on my github account. Alternatively, you can click
                        <a href="https://github.com/Jade-Marker/RC-Racing" target="_blank">here</a> to go straight to the github page.
