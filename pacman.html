                    <h2>What is it?</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project is a recreation of Pacman using the S2D library which was created by Staffordshire University.
                        <br />
                        For this project, I had to make Pacman using Staffordshire Universities S2D library.
                        This required me to implement a tile based map system, a player controller and AI for each type of ghost.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Who did what?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We were provided with an initial framework to use. During tutorials, we were also given some code snippets.
                        Additionally, during early development I used some graphics provided by the university and graphics from the original Pacman.
                        Other than those all programming, art and music was done by myself.
                    </p>

                    <h2>When was it worked on?</h2>
                    <p>Work started on the project around September of 2019 and finished on the 13th of December of 2019</p>

                    <h2>What are the controls?</h2>
                    <p>WASD to move pacman. Space to start the game, P to pause the game and R to restart on gameover.</p>

                    <h2>What went right/wrong during development?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I think that the thing that I'm most proud of from this project was the AI. During development, I wanted to make the AI of the ghosts as accurate to the original as possible.
                        Although I did have to concede with some aspects of the AI (timings for ghosts to leave the ghost house, etc), I think that the differences in the AI wouldn't be noticable to a
                        majority of players.
                        <br />
                        I think that during this project, I spent too much time on the AI. While I am proud of the AI and am happy with how it turned out,
                        I think that other parts of the program suffered because of it. E.g. there is only music on the death screen due to not having time to write any more.
                        Additionally, there is a slight problem in that the player sprite is able to overlap slightly with the maze.
                        I intended to fix this, however towards the end of development I felt that there were other more important problems to fix.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Where can I play the game/access the source code?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Both the game and the source code can be found on my github account. Alternatively, you can click
                        <a href="https://github.com/Jade-Marker/Pacman" target="_blank">here</a> to go straight to the github page.
