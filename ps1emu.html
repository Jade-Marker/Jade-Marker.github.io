                            <h2>What is it?</h2>
                            <p>
                               This was my dissertation project, which was a PS1 emulator. 
                               I chose this as my dissertation as I am very passionate about the 5th generation of consoles,
                               having written code for the PS1 before. 
                               <br>
                               For this, I was wanting to explore two main things. Firstly, how do you emulate a complex system
                               like the PS1 while maintaining code readability. Secondly, the PS1 is from the early days of 3D,
                               so it uses a fixed function pipeline. However, modern graphics apis do not. So the question then
                               is how do you efficiently merge the two? Because of this, I used Vulkan as the renderer, as it is
                               essentially the modern replacement for opengl.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>What went right/wrong during development?</h2>
                            <p>
                                One of the big things that went wrong during development was I had some health issues. Because of this,
                                I was unable to work on the project for several months. Because of this, when I was able to work
                                on it again I was under very tight deadlines. So several ideas I had planned had to be scrapped.
                                One of these was that I wanted to explore a couple different methods of emulating CPU instructions.
                                The first being a big switch case statement with the code for each instruction, and the second
                                being each instruction getting its own function.
                                <br>
                                This may seem like a tiny difference, however with the number of instructions the CPU has, 
                                this can make a huge difference to code readability. There is however a potential problem.
                                Since the second method requires a function call for each instruction, there is overhead 
                                introduced by this. While it is minimal for one instruction, the CPU runs at ~30Mhz. So this
                                small difference could end up having a large impact on performance.
                                <br>
                                One potential solution to this would be to force the functions to be inlined. However, to my 
                                knowledge there is not a crossplatform way to do this, as the inline keyword in C++ does not
                                force inlining.
                                <br>
                                When faced with the time limit, I went with the switch case method, as in theory it provided
                                equal or better performance with less work required by me.

                                <br><br>

                                One of the big things that went well during development was research/understanding, as I was able
                                to figure out the format of the MIPS 1 instruction set relatively quickly. 
                                While I had worked with different assembly languages before, they were all simple ones that
                                did not use pipelining. So I am quite proud that I was able to understand delay slots and write
                                code to check they were emulated correctly.

                                <br> <br>

                                Another thing that went well was my learning a new graphics api. Up to this point, the most
                                modern graphics api I had used was <br>Direct X 11. However, the jump from this to Vulkan/Direct X 12
                                is quite significant. Despite this, I was able to understand it and integrate it with my CPU emulation.
