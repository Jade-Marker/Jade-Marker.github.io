                            <h2>What is it?</h2>
                            <p>
                                This project is a recreation of the battle scene from deltarune, made for the Game Boy Colour. <br />
                                For this project, I had recently finished playing through deltarune chapter 2, and I thought that I could recreate the background from the combat on the Game Boy Color.
                                After doing this, I realised that the gbcompo 21 game jam ended in just over a week. So, I decided to try and recreate as much of the combat as I could in that time.
                                With the time limit, I was not able to make it playable, 
                                however I was able to implement the backgrounds, music, full size sprites for Kris, Susie and Maus and animation for Kris.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Who did what?</h2>
                            <p>
                                <a href="https://github.com/rednex/rgbds" target="_blank">RGBDS - Assembler, linker and graphics converter</a> <br />
                                <a href="https://github.com/AntonioND/gbt-player" target="_blank">GBT Player - The audio library used</a><br />
                                Everything else in the project was done by myself

                            </p>

                            <h2>When was it worked on?</h2>
                            <p>Work started on the project on the 19th of September 2021 and finished on the 1st of October 2021</p>

                            <h2>What are the controls?</h2>
                            <p>As the program is just a visual demo, there are no controls</p>

                            <h2>What went right/wrong during development?</h2>
                            <p>
                                One of the things that went right in this project was the asset ripper. As I wanted the program to be open source, I couldn't just include the original sprites.
                                To get around this, I made a C# program which would rip the graphics from the games data.win file, and then cut them up into sections.
                                Initially I thought that this would be difficult, however after some research I found that graphics data is stored as pngs in the data file.
                                So, to get all of the games graphics, I searched through the file for png headers and then directly output what was found.
                                After I had this working, I wrote a few batch files to convert the cut up graphics into the 2bpp format used by the Game Boy.

                                <br />
                                Another thing that went right with this project was the sprites. 
                                Early on, I decided to try to use the full size sprites from the game instead of scaling them down or redrawing them.
                                This presented a unique issue however, as the hardware only has the memory for 40 sprites.
                                To solve this, I set up the memory to contain 2 rows of sprites and set an interrupt for the scanline after the first row.
                                Then, I updated the memory for the first row to contain the third row of sprites.
                                Using this technique, the only sprite limitation I had to worry about was the limit of 10 sprites per scanline.

                                <br />
                                Another thing that went right with this project was the music.
                                As the project is recreating the combat, I wanted it to play a cover of rude buster. 
                                However, I was unable to find anything online that was compatible with gbt player.
                                So, I decided to try and make it myself. 
                                While I have experience with the Game Boy and with this library, in the past I just used the examples the library provides to show that audio worked.
                                So, this was my first time writing music for the system. While the cover isn't perfect, I am very happy with the results.

                                <br />
                                One of the things that went wrong with this project was the deadline.
                                I only became aware of the game jam just over a week before the deadline, so I was very strapped for time.
                                There were quite a few features that I wanted to add e.g. animations for all characters, some interactivity.
                                However with such a short amount of time, I was unable to add these.
